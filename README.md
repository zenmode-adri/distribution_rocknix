ROCKNIX is an immutable Linux distribution for handheld gaming devices developed by a small community of enthusiasts.  Our goal is to produce an operating system that has the features and capabilities that we need, and to have fun as we develop it.

## About This Fork

This is an **unofficial** fork of [AURKNIX](https://github.com/AveyondFly/distribution_rocknix) by lcdyk/KK, which is itself a fork of ROCKNIX. This fork targets the **R36S / R36 Ultra** specifically and diverges in the following areas:

### Differences from AURKNIX

| Feature | AURKNIX | This fork |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Display stack | Sway (Wayland) | Framebuffer direct (no compositor) |
| Battery life | ~1.5–2h | ~3–4h (no Sway overhead) |
| WiFi (RTL8723BU) | Not bundled | Included out-of-the-box |
| GPU driver | Panfrost / libmali | libmali (GLES 3.2, better perf) |
| OC support | Stock clocks | CPU 1512MHz / GPU 600MHz / DMC 924MHz via DTB |
| Kernel | 6.12 LTS | 6.12 LTS |

**Why no Sway?** Sway consumes significant CPU/GPU even at idle. EmulationStation runs fine directly on `/dev/fb0` via DRM fbdev emulation, matching dArkOSRE's battery life.

This fork does **not** aim to replace AURKNIX — it has a different philosophy (battery + emulation performance over desktop compositor features). Fixes that benefit both projects are submitted upstream when applicable.
